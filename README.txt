Simulations for a working paper in progress.

The goal is to examine the endogenous types of biases/errors that may occur
when decision making over time is being informed by data stream mining under
concept drift.  The "big idea" is that, due to the sequential nature of the
data analysis and decision making, early impressions can bias the downstream
data collection and hence lead to various types of myopias or biases, akin
to the "hot stove effect" described by Denrell & March (2006).

Initial theory development behind this research will be published in the 
proceedings of AMCIS 2013, the paper entitled "Simulation Research on
Endogenous Biases in Data Stream Driven Decision Making Under Concept Drift".
